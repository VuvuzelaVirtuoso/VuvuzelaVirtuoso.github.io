      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Customer-obsessed cross-functional technical delivery expert. I've earned trust with my teams and clients via being a dependable self-starter and a straight-forward communicator. I take a holistic approach to my work--I believe KPIs are only one part of the equation and seek to fully understand the user experience to give further context and expose insights. I'm known for my problem-solving and ability to streamline processes, supporting growth via improving scalability without sacrificing quality. I'm apparently also hip enough that Spotify says I have a listening age of 22 years old. Unfortunately, that does not actually mean I actually know what is "hip" with the kids.
